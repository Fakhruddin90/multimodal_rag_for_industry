    "Text Context Relevancy reason":"The text provides information on the possible positions of the manual operator and the associated colors. The possible switching positions of manual rotary operators are listed as ON, TRIP, and OFF, each with a corresponding color marking on the handle. The text also mentions that the handle clearly engages in one of these positions depending on the status of the molded case circuit breaker. Additionally, the text states that the switching positions are color-coded so that you can identify the status of the circuit breaker at a glance. Therefore, the text is relevant to the user's query.",

    "Answer Correctness reason":"The student's answer is not correct because it does not match the reference answer. The reference answer states that if the trip LED is off and the ACT led flashes in green, it means 'Internal error' status. The student's answer does not mention this specific meaning of the LEDs.",

    "Answer Correctness reason":"The student's answer is not correct because it does not match the reference answer. The reference answer states that the neutral conductor should be connected to connector 7, while the student's answer states that the neutral conductor should be connected to the designated terminal in the case of a 4-pole breaker and that connecting a line conductor to the switching pole labeled N is not permitted. These statements are not consistent with the reference answer.",
