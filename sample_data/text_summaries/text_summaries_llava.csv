Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
Drive Technology Commissioner lets you modify parameters and/or tags of 
technology objects and drives, either offline in the engineering system project or 
online in the drive. 
Using Drive Technology Commissioner allows you to plan more efficient 
commissioning and engineering times, shortening these timelines in the process. 
In projects where the same drives and technology objects (or similar ones) are 
present, it is possible to modify multiple parameters and/or tags of the objects. In 
this way, default values that must be used for multiple drives or technology objects 
can be quickly applied to the parameterization and do not need to be manually 
adjusted for each individual object.

Principle of operation 
Drive Technology Commissioner is a standalone application. It uses the Openness 
API from TIA Portal to access the parameters and tags in the project or online on 
the drive. 
Drive Technology Commissioner has a user interface that allows use of its 
functions without any additional knowledge of TIA Openness or the API.  
Additional to drives and technology objects in TIA Portal, Drive Technology 
Commissioner also supports editing of drive parameters and technology tags, 
provided you use one of the following engineering platforms:  
• 
STARTER 
• 
SIMOTION SCOUT/ SCOUT TIA 
• 
SINUMERIK Archives
