There is also a section for ""Sinumerik Archives"" and a ""TIA Version"" field with a version number of 17.0.

The interface includes a disclaimer that informs users that the application examples are not binding and do not claim to be regarding configuration, equipment, or any other aspect of the software. It also mentions that the application examples do not represent specific customer solutions and are only intended to provide support for typical tasks. The disclaimer emphasizes that users are responsible for the proper operation of the described products and that these application examples do not relieve users of their responsibility for safe handling when using the equipment.

The overall layout of the interface is clean and organized, with a clear distinction between the different options and a prominent field for the TIA version number. The text is legible and the color scheme is consistent, which should aid in retrieval."
