# Sample Data

This folder contains example data intended to demonstrate the format of the input files and the outputs generated by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation experiments and evaluation framework.

## Disclaimer
The data provided here is a **toy example** and **not the real data** used during the RAG experiments. It is only intended to showcase the required input formats and the outputs generated by the RAG framework. As such, **this data will not lead to good results** and is purely for demonstrative purposes.

## Contents

### 1. `reference_qa.xlsx`
This file contains:
- **Questions**: The questions posed in the RAG experiments.
- **Reference Answers**: The ideal answers used for evaluation purposes.
- **Metadata**: Additional details including an identifier (`doc_id`), a page number (`page_number`), and a company name (`company_name`).

### 2. `extracteed_texts_and_imgs.parquet`
This file holds:
- **Extracted Texts**: Textual content extracted from input documents.
- **Image Bytes**: Byte representation of images.

### 3. `image_summaries/`
This folder contains:
- **Textual Summaries of Images**: Generated using either GPT-4Vision or LLaVA. These summaries provide a description of the visual content of the images.

### 4. `images/`
This folder includes sample images extracted from PDFs, used to demonstrate the type of visual content processed in RAG experiments.

### 5. `rag_evaluation_results/`
This folder includes:
- **Evaluation Results File**: Contains the evaluation outcomes of a RAG pipeline. Each result includes:
  - **Grades for Each Metric**: A binary score indicating whether the respective metric was met.
  - **Reasons for Grades**: An explanation for each given grade, providing insights into the evaluation process.

### 6. `rag_outputs/`
This folder holds:
- **Example Output of a RAG System**: A sample file demonstrating the typical output produced by the RAG system during experiments.

### 7. `text_summaries/`
This folder contains:
- **Texts and Their Summaries**: An example file with original texts alongside summaries generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).

### 8. `vec_and_doc_stores/`
This folder includes:
- **Sample Vector Stores**: Two sample vector stores containing embedded texts and images/image summaries that are used for retrieval.
